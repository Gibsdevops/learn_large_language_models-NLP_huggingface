For this use case, the zero-shot-classification pipeline is very powerful: it allows you to specify which labels to use for the classification, so you don’t have to rely on the labels of the pretrained model. You’ve already seen how the model can classify a sentence as positive or negative using those two labels — but it can also classify the text using any other set of labels you like."
